### What

Mission running is PvE content: getting missions from NPC agents
and then completing them for the mission rewards and the bounties from
any hostile NPCs you destroy along the way.

### How

If you decide to pursue mission running as a source of income, you'll
want to build up standing with a particular NPC corporation in order
to get access to higher tiers of mission agents (which can then give
you harder missions with better rewards).

In order to tackle these harder missions you'll also want to continue
upgrading to larger classes of ships such as cruisers and battlecruisers.
In general, you'll want:

 * Frigates/destroyers for Level 1 missions
 * Destroyers/cruisers for Level 2 missions
 * Cruisers/battlecruisers for Level 3 missions
 * A well-fit battlecruiser for Level 4 missions

The only battlecruiser that alpha clones can use is the `Gnosis`.

You can read more on the [UniWiki 'Missions' page](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Missions).

Once you've received a mission from an agent, you can look it up in the
[EVE-Survival](http://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=MissionReports)
mission listings to get more details about what kind of dps you might face
from enemies in the mission and which enemise may trigger more spawns.

### Why

Mission running produces a fairly steady stream of ISK - the mission rewards
will pay out a certain amount, plus you'll also be paid the bounties for any
hostile NPCs you killed.

You'll also be rewarded with loyalty points (LP) for the NPC corporation that
is giving you the missions. These LP can be traded for items from the NPC corp's
Loyalty Point Store.
